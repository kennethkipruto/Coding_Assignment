<h1>Kenneth Kipruto</h1>

<p>I have had a lifelong love affair with the written and spoken word. As a young boy, I loved imitating radio news presenters to the great amusement of my friends. And once I learned to write, the amount of writing I did was limited only by the availability of pen and paper.

I now have a nine-year experience in the print media. I have worked as a writer and copy editor for two of Kenyaâ€™s leading newspapers, telling stories on (but not limited to) politics, human rights and environment. My focus at UC Berkeley is to learn how to produce multimedia stories, and to shore up my skills in narrative and long-form writing.
      
I have worked for two of Kenya's biggest circulating newspapers, first with The Star and most recently with The Standard, Kenya's oldest newspaper. In both companies, I worked as a writer initially before working as an editor.
    
I have a passion for human rights, environment and climate change and politics. My goal is to work in the humanitarian sector, and I would love to work in the Middle East after graduate school. I also wish to intern with a non-profit organisation in the US.</p>
